# This is initially for internal settings.  If all goes well using
# this new config gem, then we'll migrate entirely to the new Settings
# format for private instances too.

# Logins are not yet supported in private instances yet due to a bit more support work
# that needs to be done first.
#   e.g. how to hook up an email MTA.  Coming soon.

# When logins are enabled, an SMTP server is required to send emails to users
# for things such as forgot password, unlock account, confirm account etc.
# If `enable_logins` is set to true above, the following _are required_ to be
# filled out with valid values.

  smtp_authentication: 'plain'
  smtp_starttls: true
  smtp_open_timeout: 10
  smtp_read_timeout: 10

  # Configure the e-mail address which will be shown as 'From' in emails
  # See config/initializers/devise.rb where this is used
